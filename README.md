# shopify_cool404

## Why?
I wanted a cool 404 Page that set me apart. I searched the Web for some and found this space invader version at: https://codepen.io/arcs/pen/vOwJBw <br>
I built it into my Shopify page.

## How?
1. replace Shopify 404.liquid with my 404.liquid
2. upload 404_witchery.js.liquid into your assets <br> What this does is check if the person is on mobile or on desktop, if on desktop then cool game and if on mobile then standard 404 page 
3.upload spaceInvader.js to assets (this is where the magic comes from (P.S: I had to modify it a littel from the version on codepen)
